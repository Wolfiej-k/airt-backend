# AIrt Backend

A Flask API for image generation tasks. Designed to run with [AIrt](https://github.com/Wolfiej-k/airt), but is essentially just a wrapper for Stable Diffusion and TensorFlow NST. This script will run from [Colab](https://colab.google/) and other web-based interpreters via [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/).
